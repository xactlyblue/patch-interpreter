# Patch Interpreter

This is a Java based Git patch file interpreter. This is a rather specific case scenario usage,
as it allows you to add your own interpreters for each line of a patch file, and even automatically filters
out non-essential lines.

This probably won't have any further documentation, since it's made for a very specific scenario for my friend.
Feel free to take a look at it if you feel it'd help you in any way!

See-ya later! ðŸ‘‹
